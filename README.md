# PIE_MAP_UI
PIE_MAP_UI is the main user interface for PIE_MAP, a Google Map-like mapping application with search, path finding, and an user interface allowing mouse and keyboard input and easy navigation. 

PIE_MAP is co-developed by Raymond Yang (https://github.com/Electronic-Yoda), Stephen Wang (https://github.com/Stephenwang3801), and David Tran (https://github.com/davidtran001). 
PIE_MAP makes use of the OpenStreetMap database and employs Dijkstra's algorithm for path finding. Since some of the project is a part of the university's course work, most of PIE_MAP is kept private on GitHub. This repository shows PIE_MAP's user interface, which is a deviation from the course and is meant to greatly expand PIE_MAP's user experience.

The following features are avaliable in PIE_MAP_UI
- A Generate Buttons Algorithm
- A Namespace for the direction-finding user interface
- A Searchbar generator
- Generation of drop down lists for searchbars
- Data structures and functions/methods enabling program reactions to user input (mouse, keyboard)
- Drawing major components of the UI on canvas

PIE_MAP_UI depends on the ezgl graphics library https://github.com/mariobadr/ezgl 
as well as files in PIE_MAP_Development
