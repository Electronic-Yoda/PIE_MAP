# PIE_MAP
PIE_MAP is a mapping application written in C++ allowing users to search for intersections, parks, points of interests, and directions in 19 major cities around the world. Developed for tourists in mind, PIE_MAP offers a great user interface with impressive visuals and easy navigation. 

Since some of the project is a part of the university's course work, most of PIE_MAP is kept private on GitHub. This repository is meant to demonstrate PIE_MAP's functionality with gifs and photos. Additionally, it stores PIE_MAP's user interface and its relevant files, which are a deviation from the course and are meant to greatly expand PIE_MAP's user experience.

PIE_MAP depends on the ezgl graphics library https://github.com/mariobadr/ezgl, the GTK library, and data in OpenStreetMap. 

PIE_MAP_UI is the main user interface for PIE_MAP. The following features are avaliable in PIE_MAP_UI:
- A Generate Buttons Algorithm
- A Namespace for the direction-finding user interface
- A Searchbar generator
- Generation of drop down lists for searchbars
- Data structures and functions/methods enabling program reactions to user input (mouse, keyboard)
- Drawing major components of the UI on canvas

PIE_MAP is co-developed by Raymond Yang (https://github.com/Electronic-Yoda), Stephen Wang (https://github.com/Stephenwang3801), and David Tran (https://github.com/davidtran001).
